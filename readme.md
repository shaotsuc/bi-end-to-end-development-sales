## Description
There is an e-commerce company that sells different product to customer within the US. 

<br>

## Task (Business Questions Asked)
1. We're interested in customers who are spending quite a lot with individual orders. Can you tell us how many customers there are which have placed at least one order in which their total sales amount exceeded $2,000?

2. We're a bit worried about the increasing number of returns. Can you look into the data on returns and see whether you can find any valuable information on these returns, e.g., in the context of product category, time?

3. You are having a meeting with one of the regional managers. Can you prepare a dashboard which allows you to evaluate key performance indicators (KPI) of the region? 
    + The manager didn't provide you with any requirements and expects to take the first shot.
